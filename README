Introduction
============

Quadromania is a board game. A board of coloured tiles is mixed up by
the computer and the player's task is to restore the original board.

Supported target platforms
==========================

Currently quadromania is known to run on the following target platforms:

	* Linux/Windows 32 with libSDL
	* GP2X Wiz
	* Dingoo A320 with dingux Linux system
	* Atari MinT (compilable and running but too slow to be playable)
	* macOS (with SDL2 and Ninja build system)


Build Requirements
=================

To build Quadromania, you need the following:

1. CMake (version 3.10 or higher)
2. Ninja build system
3. SDL2 development libraries:
   - libSDL2
   - libSDL2_image
   - libSDL2_mixer
   - libSDL2_ttf

On macOS, you can install these dependencies using Homebrew:
```bash
brew install cmake ninja sdl2 sdl2_image sdl2_mixer sdl2_ttf
```

On Linux, you can install these dependencies using your package manager:
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install cmake ninja-build libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev

# Fedora
sudo dnf install cmake ninja-build SDL2-devel SDL2_image-devel SDL2_mixer-devel SDL2_ttf-devel
```

Build Instructions
=================

1. Create a build directory and navigate to it:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
```

2. Configure the project with CMake:
```bash
cmake ..
```

3. Build the project:
```bash
ninja
```

The executable will be created in the build directory.$$

Installation
============

For installation notes, see the file INSTALL or the port specific
README.

Key mapping
===========

Use Numpad + and - to alter the volume of audio effects and effects.

Use ESC to abort a game or quit the application.

The Rules
=========

The player's task is to restore all stones on the game board to red.
Game difficulty is controlled by selecting the amount of colours to
be used on the game board and a game level. The level is indicated
by the amount of initial rotations.

The computer will rotate at game start a named amount of 3x3 tile
sets and will flip their colours in the selected range. A red
tile becomes green and so on. The last possible colour will turn
red again.

In game click on the center point of a 3x3 tile set to exchange the
tiles back in the given order. 

Restore the board with a limited amount of turns.

You loose the game if you need more turns than the computer at start.
If you need less turns than the computer you score for the difference.

The score is larger if fewer turns are needed so try clearing the
board with the fewest number of turns.

If your score is good enough, it will be listed in the highscore table
with the current timestamp.

Highscores are saved to disk and loaded again at next start of the game.
